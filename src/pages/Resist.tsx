          People are at a loss about what to do. It seems so bleak as we watch
          the Trump administration and their friends tearing democracy apart,
          people's health and safety in jeopardy, international relations being
          trampled, and a bunch of rich bros playing games with people's lives
          and livelihoods. It's nauseating.
        </p>
        <p>
          But: overwhelm and hopelessness is part of the plan. It's essential
          to the plan.
        </p>
        <p>When we believe that...</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>there's nothing we can do,</li>
          <li>anything we try won't help,</li>
          <li>nobody else is doing anything,</li>
          <li>they are unstoppable,</li>
          <li>we don't know what to do,</li>
          <li>we don't have any energy to do anything...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ... all of these beliefs will keep us from acting. And the one thing
          they don't want us to do is act. People staying quiet and compliant
          is essential for making the democracy fall.
        </p>

        <h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>
        <p>
          Things I'm reminding myself, maybe they will help you too:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Choose your battles.</strong> Getting worked up about every
            new offense will wear you out fast. Ignore the noise, focus on what
            does real harm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limit news.</strong> Take in news only to the extent that
            it helps you. Doomscrolling can feel like "doing something." It
            isn't.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We aren't powerless.</strong> There ARE things people can
            do. There ARE people taking action.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consider your strengths.</strong> How can you be most
            effective? What do you have access to, what skills do you have,
            what resources do you have? (Hint: One of my skills is publishing a
            website, another is assembling information from disparate
            sources...)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share what's good.</strong> We need hope, joy, community,
            art, rest, nourishment, laughter, support... Let's take care of
            ourselves and each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nobody elected Elon.</strong> Don't assume that everything
            he does is legitimate and must be obeyed. Actually that should apply
            even to the elected ones at this point. Social media posts are not
            law. Just because Trump said it, or one of his henchmen said it,
            doesn't make it real, legal, or binding.

            . The CIA's intention was that tactics like these could be used to
            gum up the works as an act of resistance. But you might recognize
            some of the practices in this document as commonplace in a typical
            American work environment. Now imagine if you worked in an
            organization and you have been asked to do something harmful,
            unethical, immoral... maybe you're afraid of repercussions if you
            outright refuse. There might be other ways to resist.

          Below, just a few notable events from the first few weeks of Term 2.
        </p>

        <h3>February 4 update</h3>
        <h4>USAID and more</h4>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had taken over as acting head
            of USAID, the government's international aid agency, hours after
            Elon Musk said the White House was closing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Musk railed against the agency on social media, calling it a
            "criminal organization" without offering evidence. "Time for it to
            die," he wrote.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rubio said many of the agency's programs — which include health
            services and disaster relief — were worthwhile. But he said its work
            needed to align more closely with U.S. foreign policy goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trump froze billions in international aid. The decision is already
            worsening humanitarian crises, including one in Sudan, where soup
            kitchens that serve nearly a million people have shut down.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Pentagon is removing dedicated office space from four major news
            organizations, including The New York Times and NPR, to make room
            for right-wing outlets like Breitbart News and One America News.

            The C.D.C. ordered its scientists to withdraw any pending
            publications that mention terms such as "transgender," "immigrant"
            or "L.G.B.T."

            The Trump administration revoked Temporary Protected Status for more
            than 300,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. The move puts them at risk of
            deportation in coming months.

          The ability of a spoiled rich boy to destroy our country is truly

          The Department of Government Efficiency, run by President Donald
          Trump's billionaire adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has gained
          access to sensitive Treasury data including Social Security and
          Medicare customer payment systems, according to two people familiar
          with the situation. The move by DOGE, a Trump administration task
          force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and
          slash federal regulations, means it could have wide leeway to access
          important taxpayer data, among other things.

            The Justice Department fired more than a dozen prosecutors at the
            U.S. attorney's office in Washington who had been hired to
            investigate the Jan. 6 riot.

            There's an anti-vaxxer as the nominee to lead Health and Human
            Services. Sounds like a recipe for countless people not surviving
            the next pandemic. Here's hoping he doesn't get confirmed.

            He's removing security details from former government officials.
            It's chilling not just for the people affected, but also for people
            who are in comparable positions now. If doing your job gets you
            death threats, the protection of the government may run out for you
            if the guy in charge decides you aren't cool anymore.

            Inspectors general dismissals - "Inspectors general (IGs) serve as
            independent watchdogs within federal agencies, tasked with
            investigating allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse." Any notice
            provided? Of course not.

            That Nazi salute at the inauguration? Not an accident. Musk (and
            Trump) may or may not BE a Nazi, per se. But Nazis seem to think so.

          Day four or so and I just gave up trying to stay on top of this list.
          Gotta admit the guy's getting a lot done. A lot of damage.

          I added a list of news links at the top of this section. Remember that
          keeping informed should serve a good purpose. Being motivated to act
          is a good purpose. Being stressed out to the point where you are too
          overwhelmed to act is not.

          If you are reading this and calling me woke -- yes please and thank

          Because while you are sleeping, they're robbing you. Understand that.
          Trump and his buddies might tell you what you want to hear. But wake
          up and pay attention to what they DO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pay attention to what happens to your health care, your salary, how
          much you pay for food and medicine. Watch how polluted your air and
          water are, how the next major health crisis is handled, how product
          safety that is there for your protection gets eroded. Get the facts on
          how unvaccinated children are actually doing. Consider how close we
          are getting to World War Three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pay attention to how things that you know to be true (Russia invaded
          Ukraine) are suddenly talked about as if they're not. Watch for how
          many times Trump says something on video and then later denies that he
          said it. There's a lot of slippery politician talk going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that folks like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have one thing
          the rest of us don't: access to money beyond what we can even imagine.
          If they make our country unsafe to live in due to pollution, crime,
          war, or natural disasters brought on by climate change, they and their
          families and property won't suffer. When your grocery stores are
          empty, your gas station is too, and the only hospital near you has
          closed because they got hacked and they can't afford the ransom, Elon
          Musk won't be concerned about you while he's on his private jet.
        </p>
        <p>
          And consider: Who in the world benefits from the United States being
          weakened by mass firings across government agencies and chaos and
          disruption in our society? Who benefits from our withdrawing from our
          allies in Europe and the world? Who benefits from our being unprepared
          for a major outbreak of a new virus, a major cyber attack, or a
          nuclear threat from, say, Russia? I'll give you a hint: it isn't us.

          <strong>Pay attention.</strong>
